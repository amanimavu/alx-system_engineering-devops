0x08. Networking basics #1
==========================

This is a continuation of the previous project on Networking basics.
In this project, we focus on the following special IP addresses:
- `127.0.0.1` - the loopback address(localhost)
- `0.0.0.0` - non-routable meta-address that designates invalid,
unknown and non-applicable address(the "no-particular" address)

### Objectives
- What is localhost/127.0.0.1
- What is 0.0.0.0
